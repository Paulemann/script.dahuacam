# script.dahuacam

This kodi addon originates from a 'feasibility study' leveraging the documented dahua API to display recorded jpg snapshots or mp4 video sequences of my dahua web cam.
Usually, it's no effort to capture the cam's live feed in a browser or in kodi as the relevant urls are well known and can be easily found on the internet. However, access to recorded media requires installation of the NACL plugin in chrome.

Since I am using my web cams as monitoring devices I have already adapted the script.securitycam kodi addon to have a cam's live feed displayed on my tv screen when motion is detected. Hence, the next idea was to make recorded data also accessible via kodi to let me quickly check snapshots or videos captured during my absence.
Currently, the addon is at an experimental stage which, however, works quite reliable for me. It resembles the look of the playback section in th NACL plugin.

I am not planning on extending the functionality of this addon unless there is a substantial requirement. Maintencane will - for now - be limited to bug fixing. I hope others will find it useful.
